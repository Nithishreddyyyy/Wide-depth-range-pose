## Wide-Depth-Range-Pose (Modified Version)

This repository is based on [Wide-Depth-Range-Pose](https://github.com/cvlab-epfl/wide-depth-range-pose) by Yinlin Hu, SÃ©bastien Speierer, Wenzel Jakob, Pascal Fua, and Mathieu Salzmann (CVPR 2021).
It has been **modified by Nithish** to work with custom datasets and adapted for specific use cases.

---

## Overview

The original work addresses 6D object pose estimation in space, where wide depth ranges and illumination challenges make conventional approaches less effective.
This repository builds on that foundation but includes modifications to support training and evaluation on non-SwissCube datasets.
